                    <p>
                        Tyler Gregory Okonma (born March 6, 1991), known
                        professionally as Tyler, the Creator, is an American
                        rapper, singer, and record producer. He has been
                        cited
                        as an influential figure in alternative hip hop
                        during
                        the 2010s. Okonma became well known in the late
                        2000s,
                        when he emerged on the internet as the leader and
                        co-founder of the music collective Odd Future.
                        Within
                        the group, Okonma participated as a rapper,
                        producer,
                        director and actor, releasing studio albums that he
                        produced for its respective members. Okonma also
                        performed on his sketch comedy show Loiter Squad
                        (2012–2014).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Along with his collaborations with the group, Okonma
                        developed his solo career beginning with his
                        self-released debut album Bastard (2009). Bastard
                        earned him recognition in the online music press as
                        an emerging artist from the indie music scene. His
                        second album, Goblin (2011), brought him mainstream
                        media exposure, aided by the popularity of the
                        single "Yonkers" and its accompanying music video.
                        During this period, Okonma faced controversy in the
                        media for his horrorcore-influenced sound and his
                        violent, transgressive lyrical content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the release of his third album, Wolf (2013),
                        Okonma began to separate himself from his horrorcore
                        productions, turning to more accessible sounds
                        incorporating fusions of jazz, soul and R&B. In
                        2015, Tyler released his fourth album, Cherry Bomb,
                        which featured guest appearance from artists such as
                        Lil Wayne and Kanye West. In 2017, Okonma released
                        Flower Boy, followed by subsequent albums IGOR
                        (2019) and Call Me If You Get Lost (2021), all of
                        which earned him widespread critical acclaim and
                        commercial success, with the latter two albums
                        debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 and each
                        winning Best Rap Album at the 2020 and 2022 Grammy
                        Awards, respectively. His eighth studio album,
                        Chromakopia, was released on October 28, 2024.

                        Aside from his musical productions, Okonma became a
                        significant figure in fashion with his clothing
                        ventures Golf Wang and Le Fleur, and for his
                        collaborations with major brands such as Lacoste,
                        Converse and Louis Vuitton. Okonma is also the
                        founder of the Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival music
                        festival, which has been held annually since 2012,
                        and which featured appearances by Kanye West, Drake,
                        Kendrick Lamar, Lana Del Rey, and Billie Eilish,
                        among others. He has also directed all of the music
                        and promotional videos of his career, under the
                        pseudonym Wolf Haley. Okonma has won two Grammy
                        Awards, three BET Hip Hop Awards, a BRIT Award,
                        and a MTV Video Music Award. In 2019, he was named
                        "Music Innovator of the Year" by The Wall Street
                        Journal. In 2024, the Los Angeles Times featured
                        Okonma in its "L.A. Influential" series as a
                        "creator who is leaving their mark" in Los
                        Angeles.
